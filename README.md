**Overview of the Project:** <br/>
As an Analytics Consultant for Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), I developed a comprehensive KPI dashboard to provide actionable insights into the hospital's recent performance. This dashboard aims to give the executive team a clear and concise view of key metrics that impact patient care and operational efficiency.

**Key Metrics and Visualizations:** <br/>
📊 Admissions & Readmissions Over Time:
Line Chart showing trends in patient admissions and readmissions, helping to identify patterns and potential areas for improvement.<br/>

🏥 Average Length of Stay:
KPI displaying the average duration patients stay in the hospital, crucial for understanding and optimizing resource utilization. <br/>

💲 Average Cost Per Visit:
KPI displaying the average cost per hospital visit, aiding in financial planning and cost control measures. <br/>

🛡️ Insurance Coverage:
Stacked Bar Chart illustrating the number of procedures covered by insurance, highlighting the financial impact on patients and the hospital. <br/>

**Technical Highlights:**<br/>
🔧 Data Modeling:
Integrated multiple data tables, including patient records, encounters, procedures, and payers, to ensure a holistic view of hospital operations. <br/>

📈 Dynamic Slicers:
Implemented interactive slicers for flexible data exploration, allowing stakeholders to drill down into specific time periods and patient demographics. <br/>

📐 DAX Calculations:
Utilized DAX formulas to calculate critical metrics such as readmission rates and percentage of covered procedures, ensuring accurate and insightful analysis. <br/>

**Why This Matters:** <br/>
Understanding these KPIs empowers MGH to make data-driven decisions that enhance patient care, optimize operational efficiency, and manage costs effectively. This dashboard is a step towards leveraging analytics to transform healthcare delivery.
